# Smply Social- Landing page

This is a landing page built for a fake social network app that adds all social networks for a user and put them in one place. I used Figma to design and huumans for the illustrations. 

### Tools Used: 
- HTML
    - with FlexBox
- SCSS/CSS
- JS for animations, menu icon and form validation.
